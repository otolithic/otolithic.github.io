A personal website. Here I plan to store various art, music, and programming projects of mine.

Currently it hosts:  
* pretty colors: generates 2 random colors based on random rgb values. Calculates and displays their intermediate.

In the future I would like to:
* clean up the design of the index page, implement a constant horizontal carousel of the "dancing men" links
* turn "pretty colors" into a game wherein the user is prompted to adjust the red-green and blue-yellow values of the middle square until they believe they have reached the midpoint of the two random colors. Then, for two new random colors, do the same, and then find the midpoint between the two midpoints. Then the quadrilateral formed by the 4 random colors is displayed along with its exact midpoints and the accuracy of the player is rated.<sup>1</sup>
* program other interactive features
* catalogue scans and photographs of my artwork


<sup>1</sup>Based on an experiment by Robert Ennis and Qasim Zaidi, "Geometrical structure of perceptual color space is affine" (2013). I cannot find the text of this article online but a description of the experiment in question can be found in "Perceptual Spaces: Mathematical Structures to Neural Mechanisms" by Zaidi et al (2013).
