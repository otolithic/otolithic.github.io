A personal website. Here I plan to store various art, music, and programming projects of mine.

Currently it hosts:  
* [Art Gallery](http://otolithic.github.io/gallery): Selected past artworks of mine. Features digital and analog doodles, a few collages, and my old shoe art.
* [Midpoint](http://otolithic.github.io/colorgame): A game that judges your ability to predict the RGB midpoint of two randomly chosen colors. Ultimately I would like for the game to generate two more colors after submission, do the same for those colors, and then find the midpoint between the two midpoints the player chose. Then the quadrilateral formed by the 4 random colors would be displayed along with its exact midpoints and the accuracy of the player rated.<sup>1</sup>
* [Latte Foam Calculator](http://otolithic.github.io/lattecalc): simple attempt to provide the proper microwave time for getting milk to a foamable temperature
* [Monster Mash](http://otolithic.github.io/monstermash): randomly generated artwork intended to cause unease and discomfort, and also--you new best friend

In the future I would like to:
* clean up the design of the index page, implement a constant horizontal carousel of the "dancing men" links
* program other interactive features
* catalogue scans and photographs of my artwork


<sup>1</sup>Based on an experiment by Robert Ennis and Qasim Zaidi, "Geometrical structure of perceptual color space is affine" (2013). I cannot find the text of this article online but a description of the experiment in question can be found in "Perceptual Spaces: Mathematical Structures to Neural Mechanisms" by Zaidi et al (2013).
